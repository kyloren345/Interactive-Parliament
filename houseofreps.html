The Federation Chamber looks similar to the House with the green colour. The Federation Chamber is a secondary meeting place and a meeting at the Chamber can commence at the same time as a meeting in the House. It was built in 1994 as the Main Committee, and later renamed to Federation Chamber in 2012. It was built to accelerate the House's busy schedule and to increase time availability, but the only thing that is strange is that even though given its previous name, "Main Committee," it doesn't hold any committee meetings. In the Federation Chamber the members of the House debate on Bills, committee reports and they conduct member's private business. This allows members to speak on any topic of their electorate i.e the rise in gasoline prices. If there is a division in the House, then all activities in the Chamber are suspended. A division is where a determination of arising questions is made.</p></div>

Together with the Senate's vote it will be determined whether or not the Bill will become an Act or a state/national law. However Australia wouldn't be Australia without the fact that we have a Prime Minister who is in the House and plays an even bigger role and is given tons of responsibility to manage. The Prime Minister also has Ministers who manage things like Department of Defence, Department of Health and many more things. There are also three levels of Government; Local, State and Federal. The Local Government is in charge of waste collection, sewage, road projects and many more. The State Government is in charge of things like State Police, schools, hospitals. Finally the Federal Government is in charge of things like import and export, immigration, and Federal Police.</p></div>
