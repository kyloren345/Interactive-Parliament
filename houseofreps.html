The Federation Chamber looks similar to the House with the green. The Federation Chamber is a secondary meeting place and a meeting at the Chamber can commence at the same time as the House. It was built in 1994 as the Main Committee, and later renamed to Federation Chamber in 2012. It was built to accelerate the House's busy schedule and to increase time availability, but the only thing that is sort of weird is that even though given its previous name Main Committee it doesn't hold committee meetings. In the Federation Chamber the House debates on bills, debates committee reports and conducting private members' business, which allows members to speak on any topic of their electorate i.e the rise in gasoline prices. If there is a division in the House, then all activities in the Chamber are suspended. A division is where a determination of questions arising is made.</p></div>
