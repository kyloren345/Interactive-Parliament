    <h1>The House of Representatives</h1>
    <p>The House of Representatives is responsible for managing international relationships with other countries i.e Solomon Islands. They are also in charge of the national laws throughout Australia, when there is a proposed law change wanted to be made it goes through The House of Representatives then it also goes to the Senate, so they share a responsibility in the managment of law changes. After that it goes to the Governor-General and if given Royal Assent which means that only if the bill is approved by the Governor-General then it will become and Act.</p>
    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>The House of Representatives is green because of the inspiration from The House of Commons in the British Parliament and the greenish greyish tones are inspired from the Australian landscape.</p>
    <p>At the open end of the U-shape in The House of Representatives is where the Speaker of the House sits at and he is responsible for the orderly running of the House. Other Government members sit at on the right hand side of the Speaker of The House then the Opposition members sit on the left hand side of him. The Prime Minister and the Leader of The Opposition sit at a table in the centre. There are four viewing galleries one directly above the speaker which is reserved for the Press Gallery and then the other three aroud the House are open for the public to visit at any time.</p>
    <h2>Federation Chamber</h2>
    <p>All members of the House are also members of the Federation Chamber. The Federation Chamber looks similar to the House with the green. The Federation Chamber is a secondary meeting place and a meeting at the Chamber can commence at the same time as the House. It was built in 1994 as the Main Commitee, and later renamed to Federation Chamber in 2012. It was built to accelerate the House's busy schedule and to increase time availability, but the only thing that is sort of weird is that even though given it's previous name Main Commitee it doesn't hold comittee meetings. In the Federation Chamber the House debates on bills, debates commitee reports and conducting private members' business, which allows members to speak on any topic of their electorate i.e the rise in gasoline prices. If there is a division in the House then all activities in the Chamber are suspended. A division is where a determination of questions arising is made.</p>
    <h2>Speaker of the House</h2>
    <p>The job that the Speaker of the House is given is to make sure that when a meeting at the House is arranged the Speaker of the House is responsible of running it in the provision of the Constitution and is in an orderly manner. The Speaker of the House is also given the task of managing the duties performed in the chair which is quite a challenging task on it's own. When the Speaker isn't in the House they play an even bigger role in the Department of the House of Representatives he has to work with the President of the Senate to maintain to upkeep the Parliamnet House and around it.</p>
    <h2>Important People in the House</h2>
    <p>Everybody in the House plays a major role in the managment of Australian Constitutional rules and how they think that the proposed rule change to the Constitution will go by voting or debating on what they think about it. Together with the Senate they will make it and Act or a state/national law. However Australia wouldn't be Australia without the fact that we have a Prime Minister who is in the House and plays an even bigger role and is given tons of responsibility to manage. The Prime Minister also has Ministers who manage things like Department of Defence, Department of Health and many more things. There are also three levels of Government; Local, State and Federal, Local is in charge of waste collection, sewage, road projects and many more. State is in charge of things like State Police, schools, hospitals. Federal is in charge of things like import and export, immigration, and Federal Police. </p>
    <h2>Deputy Clerk</h2>
    <p>The Deputy Clerk is the only non-Member of the House to have a speaking role their job is to read out the bills passed throughout the different stages of it's progress through the House and they only read out the title of the bill. They also need to certify the passage of bills through the Parliament recording the decisions made by Parliament members. The Clerks also have several Clerk Assistants to support the Clerks in their duties.</p>
    <h2>The Prime Minister</h2>
    <p>The role that the Prime Minister undertakes is the role of leading the parliamentary party. The Prime Minister is also the key spokesperson for Australia, he is the Head of Cabinet, Leader of the Government and lastly the Most Senior Minister. The Head of Cabinet's role is to lead the main part of the decision making process of government. The Prime Minister also has to chair meetingd in which the government debate or votes on bills, selecting other members of Parliament to become their Ministers, leading the Cabinet in deciding the governments policies.</p>
    <h2>Searjeant at Arms</h2>
    <p>The Searjeant at Arms is required to escort the Speaker of the House in and out of the House, while carrying the Mace. Other responsibilities include assisting the Speaker of the House to maintain the flow and order, recording the attendance of members, standing guard during a division vote when all the doors to the floor of the House are locked, delivering messages in a formal manner from the House to the Senate and playing an important role in ceremonial occasions i.e the opening of Parliament. The Searjeant at Arms is required to be in the House of Representatives at the beginning of each sitting day*. </p>
    <h2>The House of Representatives' Party Whip</h2>
    <p>There are two Party Whips one is part of the Senate and the other is in the House of Representatives, their roles include, meeting with the whips of opposing parties to plan the parliamentary day and set the agenda. More include; organising a list of party members who wish to speak on bills and other business and giving then this to the President of the Senate. counting and taking notes on the votes in a division, giving advice and support for party members. The Party Whip's name originates from the British Parliament like so many of the other things including the colours of the House and Senate, the reason it is called Whip is because sport of fox-hunting and the name Whip was used in the British Parliament since way back in the 17th century.</p>
