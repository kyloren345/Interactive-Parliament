    <h1>The House of Representatives</h1>
    <p>The House of Representatives is responsible for managing international relationships with other countries i.e Solomon Islands. They are also in charge of the national laws throughout Australia, when there is a proposed law change wanted to be made it goes through The House of Representatives then it also goes to the Senate, so they share a responsibility in the managment of law changes. After that it goes to the Governer-General and if given Royal Assent which means that only if the bill is approved by the Governer-General then it will become and Act.</p>
    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>The House of Representatives is green because of the inspiration from The House of Commons in the British Parliament and the greenish greyish tones are inspired from the Australian landscape.</p>
    <p>At the open end of the U-shape in The House of Representatives is where the Speaker of the House sits at and he is responsible for the orderly running of the House. Other Government members sit at on the right hand side of the Speaker of The House then the Opposition members sit on the left hand side of him. The Prime Minister and the Leader of The Opposition sit at a table in the centre. There are four viewing galleries one directly above the speaker which is reserved for the Press Gallery and then the other three aroud the House are open for the public to visit at any time.</p>
    <h2>Federation Chamber</h2>
    <p>All members of the House are also members of the Federation Chamber. The Federation Chamber looks similar to the House with the green. The Federation Chamber is a secondary meeting place and a meeting at the Chamber can commence at the same time as the House. It was built in 1994 as the Main Commitee, and later renamed to Federation Chamber in 2012. It was built to accelerate the House's busy schedule and to increase time availability, but the only thing that is sort of weird is that even though given it's previous name Main Commitee it doesn't hold comittee meetings. In the Federation Chamber the House debates on bills, debates commitee reports and conducting private members' business, which allows members to speak on any topic of their electorate i.e the rise in gasoline prices. If there is a division in the House then all activities in the Chamber are suspended. A division is where a determination of questions arising is made.</p>
    <h2>Speaker of the House</h2>
    <p>The job that the Speaker of the House is given is to make sure that when a meeting at the House is arranged the Speaker of the House is responsible of running it in the provision of the Constitution and is in an orderly manner. The Speaker of the House is also given the task of managing the duties performed in the chair which is quite a challenging task on it's own.</p>
    <h2>Important People in the House</h2>
    <p>Everybody in the House plays a major role in the managment of Australian Constitutional rules and how they think that the proposed rule change to the Constitution will go by voting or debating on what they think about it. Together with the Senate they will make it and Act or a state/national law. However Australia wouldn't be Australia without the factor that we have a Prime Minister who is in the House and plays an even bigger role and is given tons of responsibility to manage. The Prime Minister also has Ministers who manage things like Department of Defence, Department of Health and many more things. There are also three levels of Government; Local, State and Federal, Local is in charge of waste collection, sewage, road projects and many more. State is in charge of things like State Police, schools, hospitals. Federal is in charge of things like import and export, immigration, and Federal Police. </p>
    <h2>Deputy Clerk</h2>
    <p>The Deputy Clerk is the only non-Member of the House to have a speaking role their job is to read out the bills passed throughout the different stages of it's progress through the House and they only read out the title of the bill.</p>
