    <h1>The Australian Senate</h1>
    <p>The Senate has a total of 76 senators, 2 represent each territory, the Senators represent the views of Australians and discuss the matters of international and national importance. When the national laws are changed via a referendum it is then passed on to the House of Representatives and after that if the Senate and the House agree in identical form then the bill is passed on to the Governer-General for him to give the Royal Assent only then it will become a law/Act.</p>
    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>The Senate's colour is inspired from the House of Lords in the British Parliment as well and the light red colours are from the colours of the desert landscape of Australia.</p>
    <p>The U-shape of the Senate is different to the House because in the Middle is the President of the Senate The Honourable Sue Lines and around her are the 76 senators, on her right side there are the Government Senators and on her left side are the Opposition Senators, then the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate sit at a table in the centre.</p>
    <h2>Senators</h2>
    <p>The composition of the Senate is 26 Labor Party Government senators, 32 Coalition (Opposition) senators, 12 Australian Greens senators, two Paul Hansen's One Nation senators, two Jacqui Lambie Network senators, one United Australia Party senator, and one Independent senator.</p>
    <h2>President of the Senate</h2>
    <p>The job of The Honourable Sue Lines who is the current President of the Senate is to guide and regulate proceedings in the chamber, to oversee administration of the Department of the Senate and together with the Speaker of the House of Representatives to regulate the Department of Parliamentary Services.</p>
    <h2>Clerk</h2>
    <p>The Senate has it's own Clerk who is responsible for being the Principal Advisor to all senators on matters relating to the business and procedures of the Senate and its commitees. When there is meeting in the Senate the Clerk sits at the table together with the President of the Senate.</p>
